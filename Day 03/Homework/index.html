<h1>About GOA</h1>
<p>GOA is academy where we learn about programing.</p>
<p>Global Online Academy (GOA) is a nonprofit organization which provides online classes, workshops, and other educational resources for students and teachers.[1] Accredited courses for middle and high school students are offered through GOA by a consortium of about 120 member schools, all independent.</p>
<h1>Structure</h1>
<p>GOA courses are taught online by teachers at Academy member schools.[5] These teachers create the coursework and schedule for each course, but the student experience is largely asynchronous.[6] Each course is 15 weeks long, with students spending (on average) 5-7 hours per week on work related to the course.</p>
<p>Students at member schools have access to any course in the GOA catalog.</p>
<h1>Activity</h1>
<p>In 2020, GOA partnered with Western Governors University to offer public schools an online "Next Generation Teaching Series" focused on helping teachers effectively teach online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>During the 2020-2021 school year, GOA enrollment rose 40 percent, and students from 26 countries were taking GOA courses.</p>
