#Sequencing: This means that the computer will run your code in order, one line at a time from the top to the bbottom of your program. It will start at line 1, then execute line 2 then line 3 and so on till it reaches the last line of your program.
#Selection: Sometimes you only want some lines of code to be run only if a condition is met, otherwise you want the computer to ignore these lines and jump over them. This is achieved using IF statements. e.g.(for exsample) If a condition is met then lines 4, 5, 6, are executed otherwise the computer jumps to line 7 without even looking at line 4,5 and 6.
#Iteration: Sometimes you want the computer to execute the same lines of code severaltimes. This is done using a loop. There are three types of loops: For loops, while loops and repeat until loops. Thatâ€™s handy as it enables you not to have to copy the same lines of code many times..
